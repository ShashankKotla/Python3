#Python List were used as arrays in python3.
#Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.


cars = ['tesla', 'benz', 'bmw']
# print(cars[0])
# cars[0] = 'Toyota'
# print(len(cars))


# for x in cars:
#     print(x)


# cars.append('toyota')
# cars.pop(2)
# cars.remove('bmw')
# cars.reverse()
# cars.sort()]
# cars2 = ['toyota', 'volvo']
# cars.extend(cars2)
# print(cars.count('volvo'))
# print(cars)


# print(cars)
# cars.insert(1, 'Tata')
# print(cars)

print('hello\fworld')

print('hello\nworld ')

cars[2] = 'Me'
