#Nested if - one inside another, like if:if:

# x = 41

# if x>10:
#     print("Above 10")
#     if x > 20:
#         print('and it also greater than 20')
#     else:
#         print("But not above 20.")
# else:
#     print("Out of scope.")

#Pass - avoid getting error by using this in an empty space

# o = 4
# l = 9
# if l > o:
#     # print('greater')
#     pass
# else:
#     print("Not now")
