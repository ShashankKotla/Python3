# there are 2 primitive loops - while & for

#note :  while loop "requires relevant variables to be ready", in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.

# i = 0
# while i<6:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# i = 0
# while i <9:
#     print(i)
#     if i == 4:
#         break
#     i +=1


# i = 0
# while i <9:
#     # i +=1
#     if i == 4:
#         continue
#     print(i)
#     i+=1 # produce endless loop,because i value will be 4
